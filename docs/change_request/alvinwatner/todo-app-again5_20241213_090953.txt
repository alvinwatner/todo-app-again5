Specific Changes:
- Add user profile access point:
  * Place circular avatar in top right corner of main screen
  * Use default profile icon if no user image available
  * Add subtle border around avatar
  * Make avatar responsive to taps
- Create profile navigation:
  * Implement smooth transition to profile screen
  * Show loading state during navigation
  * Handle back navigation gracefully
- Update app bar layout:
  * Maintain consistent spacing around avatar
  * Ensure avatar doesn't overlap with other elements
  * Keep existing todo functionality intact

Constraints:
- Avatar size should be proportional to app bar height
- Touch target should be at least 44x44 points
- Maintain existing app bar elevation and styling
- Support both portrait and landscape orientations

Expected Output:
A clickable circle avatar in the top right corner that navigates to the user profile screen when tapped. The avatar should be visually integrated with the existing app bar design and provide clear visual feedback during interaction. The navigation should feel smooth and intuitive to users.

Success Metrics:
- Avatar consistently visible in top right
- Smooth navigation to profile screen
- Clear visual feedback on tap
- Proper handling of navigation state
- Maintains existing todo functionality
