Specific Changes:
- Create new dialog for adding todo items:
  * Add floating action button to open dialog
  * Include text input field for todo description
  * Add save and cancel buttons in dialog
- Implement todo creation functionality:
  * Connect dialog input to todo list
  * Clear input field after successful addition
  * Dismiss dialog on save or cancel
- Update main todo list:
  * Refresh list when new item added
  * Maintain scroll position after addition
  * Show brief success indicator

Constraints:
- Dialog must be dismissible by tapping outside
- Keep input field focused when dialog opens
- Prevent empty todo items from being added
- Maintain existing todo list sorting/filtering
- Ensure dialog works in both portrait and landscape

Expected Output:
When users tap the add button, a dialog appears with a text input field. After entering text and tapping save, the dialog closes and the new todo item appears in the main list with a subtle animation. The dialog should feel natural and integrated with the existing app design.

Success indicators:
- New todos appear immediately in the list
- Dialog closes smoothly after adding item
- Empty submissions are prevented
- Input field clears between openings
- Keyboard appears automatically with dialog
